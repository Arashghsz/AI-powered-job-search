We are a public pre-K and elementary school (3 to 12 years old children) located in Vila-seca, an industrial and touristic village on the Costa Dorada, with many families converging from very different backgrounds and cultures. It is because of this that we believe that the Erasmus+ projects that we are implementing (languages and cultures, Arts and Music, Social Emotional Learning, STEAM, ecology, chess and diversity) are ideal for our community. Sant Bernat Calvo has been selected to carry out all these innovation projects that have contributed to create a leading position of our school in this field. The school learning language is Catalan, but most of our students' mother language is Spanish and they learn it at our school, too. They study English as a foreign language. Two years ago our school received the Erasmus Accreditation, an award that confirms that we have set a plan to implement high quality mobility activities as a great effort to develop our school goals. We also want to open up our organization to cross-border exchange and cooperation. According to the Erasmus+ programme,  organizations that already have an Erasmus accreditation are awarded an excellence label to recognise their past work and dedication to quality education. At Sant Bernat Calvó we improve our students' cultural competence by designing a school that reflects and represents the community we serve, preparing them for a multicultural and global future. Our mission is to attract, develop, and retain a collaborative and dynamic teachers team in order to establish a stimulating work environment.

In the classroom, they are viewed as an additional teacher who is responsible for working closely with students. Interns work as  support teachers in a classroom, improving their skills under the supervision of more experienced educators. They receive professional development in a variety of areas related to teaching, including classroom management and lesson design.
