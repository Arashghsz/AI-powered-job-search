Looking for HEROS to innovate artisanal glassblowing in Murano Venice Italy,Wave Murano Glass,"Venice, Italy",4 months,"23 Jan, 2025","31 Mar, 2025","Art and Design, Business Studies and/or Management Science, Engineering and/or Technology",https://erasmusintern.org/traineeship/looking-heros-innovate-artisanal-glassblowing-murano-venice-italy,18,"to accelerate a new Renaissance for glassmaking by merging heritage with innovation, and sustainability. For us, it’s not just about molten glass; it’s about turning bold ideas into meaningful impact. Why do we care about your ideas? Because we’re invested in the next generation of changemakers. A few years ago, rocket engineering students from USC Rocket Propulsion Lab visited us. We jokingly suggested they work on furnace efficiency, and several applied for internships. Their projects reduced our energy footprint by 30%, significantly improving the sustainability of our operations. That’s the level of brilliance we seek. So here’s the deal: If you have a project idea—wild, practical, technical, artistic, or transformative—that could help us drive innovation and sustainability in glassmaking, we want to hear it. Whether you’re an engineer, marketer, designer, researcher, artist, or a mix of all these roles, Wave Murano Glass is your platform to leave your mark. Be bold. Be specific. Let’s shape the future of glass together. Examples to inspire your ideas: The challenges we face are numerous, but so are the opportunities. Here are just a few examples of areas where you could contribute: Soaring energy costs and sustainability in production Competition from imitations and maintaining authenticity Revitalizing an aging workforce and attracting new talent Reducing dependency on tourism Addressing environmental pressures Navigating the digital transition Managing risks from climate change and infrastructure challenges Projects must be completed by the end of the Erasmus period and demonstrate a clear level of functionality or return on investment. Imagine you were an employee in the real job market: estimate the value of your time during the Erasmus period and prove that your solution generates at least 30% more value than the total cost of your time and resources (or even 1000% or 10,000%!). We also reserve the right to award a monetary prize to students who successfully complete their projects. The size of the prize will depend and be proportional on the real value added to the company. Projects that are unfinished or show to be unsustainable will mean a bad review from us on the erasmus evaluation form, so we are looking for people with steel nerves and high creativity/confidence. What we offer: Accommodation: Simple, shared accommodation above our factory, featuring 5 rooms, 2 shared bathrooms, and 1 kitchen. This is FREE and keep in mind that a single room in a student apartment in Venice would cost several hundred €/month. A refundable deposit of €100 is required, returned at the end of your stay if the accommodation is left in good condition. Working Hours: Official hours are from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, with a lunch break from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM. BUT keep in mind that you will have to finish the project by the end ofthe erasmus so you might need to work extra. Meals: Lunch is available Monday to Friday for €3 per day, freshly cooked and Italian nonna style (no vegan or vegetarian option) Apply Now: Submit your idea through the form below. We will review every proposal and get back to you personally.",0.22824804,0.12766625,0.22407933,0.21204239,0.198009

They  would work with us to transform public education by implementing innovative Erasmus+ projects in order to prepare our students for success in Secondary School. We are a public pre-K and elementary school (3 to 12 years old children) located in Vila-seca, an industrial and touristic village on the Costa Dorada, with many families converging from very different backgrounds and cultures. It is because of this that we believe that the Erasmus+ projects that we are implementing (languages and cultures, Arts and Music, Social Emotional Learning, STEAM, ecology, chess and diversity) are ideal for our community. Sant Bernat Calvo has been selected to carry out all these innovation projects that have contributed to create a leading position of our school in this field. The school learning language is Catalan, but most of our students' mother language is Spanish and they learn it at our school, too. They study English as a foreign language. Two years ago our school received the Erasmus Accreditation, an award that confirms that we have set a plan to implement high quality mobility activities as a great effort to develop our school goals. We also want to open up our organization to cross-border exchange and cooperation. According to the Erasmus+ programme,  organizations that already have an Erasmus accreditation are awarded an excellence label to recognise their past work and dedication to quality education. At Sant Bernat Calvó we improve our students' cultural competence by designing a school that reflects and represents the community we serve, preparing them for a multicultural and global future. Our mission is to attract, develop, and retain a collaborative and dynamic teachers team in order to establish a stimulating work environment. At Sant Bernat Calvó, interns are an essential part of the classroom.They serve as both a collaborator and an assistant. In the classroom, they are viewed as an additional teacher who is responsible for working closely with students. Interns work as  support teachers in a classroom, improving their skills under the supervision of more experienced educators. They receive professional development in a variety of areas related to teaching, including classroom management and lesson design. They develop not only their intercultural skills, but also learn new teacher skills that will help them in their professional future as educators. They could also combine their traineeship with other kinds of cultural activities or trips and they could take part in traditional events in our area. The location of our village is ideal to visit great places such as Tarragona (5 minutes by train) or Barcelona (one hour by train). They can walk to PortAventura and Ferrari Land or spend their free time on the beautiful beaches of Salou or La Pineda (5 minutes by bus). Unfortunately, we cannot assume the costs incurred by your internship. You should afford them and your medical insurance, too.

Sant Bernat Calvo has been selected to carry out all these innovation projects that have contributed to create a leading position of our school in this field.

Two years ago our school received the Erasmus Accreditation, an award that confirms that we have set a plan to implement high quality mobility activities as a great effort to develop our school goals. We also want to open up our organization to cross-border exchange and cooperation. According to the Erasmus+ programme,  organizations that already have an Erasmus accreditation are awarded an excellence label to recognise their past work and dedication to quality education. At Sant Bernat Calvó we improve our students' cultural competence by designing a school that reflects and represents the community we serve, preparing them for a multicultural and global future. Our mission is to attract, develop, and retain a collaborative and dynamic teachers team in order to establish a stimulating work environment.

Please note that interns working on the festival during the winter months will not be participating in the actual festival (unless their internship extends to nine months or one year). The winter months are also quieter and thus, you will likely be working on other EU projects as well. Winter interns will be involved in post-evaluation, i.e. helping to analyse survey responses and report writing. The social media platforms must also be maintained and will require correspondence with other interns and staff to promote the work of our EU projects. Additional responsibilities include: a) maintaining contact with stakeholders and volunteers to prepare for the next festival, b) aid in grant writing and artist open calls, c) administrative and logistical support pertaining to artist applications, d) aid in recruiting new organisations/partners and sponsors and e) aid in coordinating public engagement events in the run-up to the festival, including “Science in the City Goes to School” — bringing the festival to Malta’s public schools. Summer interns can expect an intense, but very rewarding, experience. Tasks are highly variable and involve management of partners — from overseeing logistical requirements on the day of the festival and signed contracts, to helping recruit and train volunteers. Other responsibilities include: a) aid in developing and executing the evaluation plan on the day, b) social media content generation, c) writing/editing (e.g. press releases, blogs, newspaper articles, etc.), d) coordinating workshops and training, e) design tasks (e.g. online posters, photography, videography) and f) managing ordering and delivery of materials (e.g. SitC t-shirts for staff and volunteers, banners, posters, etc.).

You will welcome the clients before the trip starts, and make them feel comfortable. After the boat leaves the port, you will kindly offer them a welcome drink and start asking each client what they would like to eat later on (they can choose between fish, meat or vegetarian). After 50 minutes of sight-seeing we will reach the most southern point of Istria: at ""Cape Kamenjak"" where underwater cave can be found. There will be a stop for around 30 minutes. Your role here is really important! Who wants will jump into the water. You should show them the entrance to the cave and take care about their security by making sure that every tourist goes back on board safely. After this break the ride continues around ""Porer"": an austro-hungarian lighthouse. During this panoramic tour, it is your turn to entertain the costumers: you will explain them a short history about the lighthouse (construction date, its function, etc.). It doesn’t have to sound like a high-school performance, feel free to tell jokes, to laugh with them, stay easy! The next stop will be a brunch or lunch break. The boat stops in a calm bay where a Croatian authentic meal will be served on board. Here your job is simple: usually one animator stays behind the bar and prepares the drinks and the other serves the different meals. You will do this duty at each boat-trip (in the high-season twice a day). Teamwork represents a stronghold for us and for this reason we always try to integrate the „new“ co-workers in our team as fast as possible. Our opinion is, that fun and good working atmosphere are the basis for a successful job. Our company is looking for serious and motivated co-workers (trainees or workers) for the summer season, who are willing to come to one of the top holiday-destinations in Croatia. To work with us, you won’t need any previous knowledge in tourist animation (but a previous experience can be a great advantage). A good animator should not be shy and should have an open-minded and easy-going personality; your mission is to give our customers an amazing time! You should spend 6 hours with unknown people and speak with them, tell them jokes, ask them if they need something and answer their questions and needs. You should know how to adapt to different type of persons, and make sure that a pleasant environment constantly stays on board. Moreover, every day you will have the chance to swim in the wonderful underwater cave with crystal-clear blue water; you will breath the sea air; enjoy the sun; and meet people from all around the world! This experience will help to shape your character, being more open-minded, make great connections and moreover improve your language skills (especially in English and German and other languages if you are motivated). We also wish to mention that we take not only good care of our crew but also customers, that is why we are listed number 1 place on TripAdvisor in Medulin for boat excursions and recieved many years in a row the Tripadvisor traveler choice.). https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g608707-d6032178-Reviews-M ...

Advanced nanofiltration membranes for enhanced stability in water treatment,"Wetsus, european center of excellence for sustainable water technollogy","Leeuwarden, Netherlands",5 months,"4 Feb, 2025","28 Feb, 2025",Engineering and/or Technology,https://erasmusintern.org/traineeship/advanced-nanofiltration-membranes-enhanced-stability-water-treatment,14,"In recent years, polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) nanofiltration (NF) membranes have shown significant advancements in separation properties for various applications. A key advantage of these membranes lies in the versatility of the layer-by-layer (LbL) technique, which allows for precise tuning of the chemistry and performance of NF membranes, enabling them to go beyond the capabilities of conventional NF membranes. Especially, PEM membranes based on PDADMAC (poly(diallyldimethylammoniumchloride)) and PSS (poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate)) show excellent chemical stability, allowing for operation at extreme pH conditions and cleaning with hypochlorite. However, a significant drawback of PDADMAC/PSS-based membranes is their reduced stability in highly saline streams, as the ionic bonds that hold the PEM layer together weaken. This project aims to explore various crosslinking methods to introduce covalent bonds, thereby enhancing membrane stability and fine-tuning membrane selectivity for specialized water treatment applications. Tasks: Membrane fabrication (Non-solvent induced phase separation) and modification (layer-by-layer technique, chemical crosslinking) Membrane characterization including thickness measurement, filtration experiments (water permeability, salt retention, conductivity) and other relevant analysis Data analysis Writing a report Your profile: Background in chemical/environmental engineering, material science, chemistry, physical chemistry, or related fields; Experience and knowledge in membrane/polymer technology would be a plus. highly motivated, enthusiastic, and willing to learn about membrane technology, and surface chemistry; Established hands-on laboratory and instrument experience would be a plus.

This project aims to contribute filling this gap by supporting a nascent collaboration between the Polin group at the Mediterranean Institute for Advanced Studies (CSIC, Spain) in Mallorca and the Kierkegaard group at the University of Copenhagen (Denmark). Your task will be to use pipette micromanipulation and high-speed video microscopy to produce a high-quality database of flagellar waveforms.

Ecological and evolutionary implications of facilitative interactions among plants,Spanish National Research Council (CSIC),"Moncada (Valencia), Spain",6 months,"6 Feb, 2025","6 May, 2025",Natural Sciences,https://erasmusintern.org/traineeship/ecological-and-evolutionary-implications-facilitative-interactions-among-plants,13,"In semiarid environments plant facilitative interactions can be crucial for the establishment of some species, and therefore influence the structure of plant communities. In facilitative interactions, one of the species receive a benefit from the association, without reverting in any damage for any of the species involved. Traditionally, facilitative interactions have been considered from an ecological perspective and usually focusing on pair-wise interactions, in which only two plant species interact. However, in environments where plant interactions are relevant for species survival, they might also result in micro-evolutionary processes, and the benefits of these associations might not be only due to the presence of a given nurse plant species, but instead to the co-occurrence of multiple plant species, with a diverse set of functional traits, coexisting in a given vegetation patch. We explore both ecological and evolutionary implications of plant facilitation, assessing the contribution of direct (through pair-wise nitrogen (N) transfer) and indirect (N transfer with ecological networks) plant-plant interactions on plant co-existence. We also develope greenhouse experiments to assess the potential micro-evolutionary processes driven by plant facilitation This can improve our mechanistic understanding of the ecological factors that can potentially shape the diversity and productivity of natural systems. Therefore, the student will have the opportunity to participate in ongoing field campaigns to assess plant facilitation in different study sites in south Alicante and Valencia, sample co-occurrence of plant species in vegetation patches and follow ongoing greenhouse experiments to assess the genetic differences between populations with different neighborhoods.
